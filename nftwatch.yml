# nftwatch internal configs:

nftwatch_config_NftCommandLine: '/usr/sbin/nft -nn --handle list ruleset'
#nftwatch_config_NftCommandLine: '/usr/sbin/nft -nn --handle --terse list ruleset'
# ^ The command line used to read the nftables output.
#   The line with:  `--terse`  omits contents of sets.
#   There are other options available - look at:  `nft --help`  to list the
#     available options in the section:  `Options (ruleset list formatting)`


nftwatch_config_RefreshPeriod: 2
# ^ Refresh the display every n seconds.
#     Any value >= 0.1 is supported
#   You can use the interactive viewer to slow/speed this value in real time
#     but you cannot speed it up past 0.1 sec refresh interval.
#   Bigger values (slower refreshes) raises your chances of seeing stats from
#     low bandwidth machines (at higher speeds they will only show up briefly).


nftwatch_config_TruncateComment: 32
# ^ Truncate comment field length to max n chars
#   Supported values:
#     0 or False  to disable comment display
#     1-999  to display this fixed comment length
#     >= 1000  to read the length of your longest comment and use that value.
#   Best to show enough chars of the comment to understand what you meant
#     but not too many as to lose the rules either.


nftwatch_config_TruncateDetails: 40
# ^ Truncate details field length to max n chars
#   Supported values:
#     Any value >= 1 for the number of chars to display.
#     False  or 0  to display the full details field.
#   As of now - this item is not used.


nftwatch_config_DisplayMode: human
# ^ Controls the display mode. Supported values:
#     human   Counters are truncated to human readable values.
#     full    Counters are displayed in full.
#     fullc   Counters are displayed in full, comma separated at the thousands mark.
#   As of now - this item is not used and only human display is supported.


nftwatch_config_DisplayHandle: true
# ^ Display the rule handle?
#   As of now - this item is not used and is always displayed.
